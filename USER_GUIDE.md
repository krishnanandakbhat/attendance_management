# End User Guide

This guide explains basic workflows for end users (teachers / staff) who will use the Attendance Management System.

1. Accessing the app

- The app is typically hosted on a private host accessible within the organization. Your admin will provide the URL.
- You will be given an account (username + password) or self-register if enabled.

2. Login

- Open the app in a browser and login using your credentials.
- The system limits concurrent devices per user (default: 2). If you exceed this, revoke an old device from the Sessions page.

3. Students

- Add new students via the Students -> Create page. Fields:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Level
  - Price per class
- Edit or delete students as needed.

4. Mark Attendance

- Navigate to Attendance -> Mark and choose a student and date.
- The system prevents duplicate attendance for the same student/date.

5. Reports

- Use Reports -> Export to download CSV/XLSX summaries for selected date ranges.

6. Sessions (Device management)

- Use Sessions page to view active sessions and revoke devices. This helps if you reach the device limit.

7. Security tips

- Don’t share your credentials.
- Log out from devices you no longer use.

If you need help, contact your system administrator with the app hostname and the issue details.
